## Instance Contract Errors

The instance contract (`Raffle`) handles individual raffle operations. All error codes are defined in the `Error` enum in [`contracts/raffle/src/instance/mod.rs`](contracts/raffle/src/instance/mod.rs).

### General Errors (1-10)

## Error Code Mapping

### JavaScript/TypeScript Example

```typescript
// Frontend error mapping
const errorMessages: Record<number, string> = {
  // Instance errors
  1: "Raffle not found",
  2: "This raffle is not currently active",
  3: "Sorry, all tickets have been sold!",
  4: "Insufficient funds to complete this action",
  5: "You are not authorized to perform this action",
  11: "Prize not yet deposited",
  12: "Prize has already been claimed",
  13: "Prize has already been deposited",
  14: "You are not the winner of this raffle",
  15: "Please wait before claiming your prize",
  21: "Invalid parameters provided",
  22: "This action is not allowed in the current raffle state",
  23: "Contract is temporarily paused",
  24: "Cannot change raffle to the requested state",
  25: "This raffle has ended",
  31: "Minimum ticket requirement not met",
  32: "Multiple tickets not allowed for this raffle",
  33: "No tickets have been sold yet",
  34: "Ticket not found",
  41: "Calculation error occurred",
  42: "Contract already initialized",
  43: "Contract not initialized",
  44: "Please try again later",

  // Factory errors
  101: "Factory already initialized",
  102: "You are not the admin",
  103: "Factory is temporarily paused",
  104: "Invalid parameters provided",
  105: "Raffle not found",
  111: "Admin transfer already pending",
  112: "No pending admin transfer",
};

function handleContractError(errorCode: number): string {
  return errorMessages[errorCode] || "An unknown error occurred";
}
```

### React Example

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface ErrorDisplayProps {
  errorCode: number;
}

const ERROR_MESSAGES: Record<number, string> = {
  3: "Sorry, all tickets have been sold!",
  4: "Insufficient funds. Please top up your wallet.",
  14: "You are not the winner of this raffle",
  25: "This raffle has ended",
  // ... add more as needed
};

export const ErrorDisplay: React.FC<ErrorDisplayProps> = ({ errorCode }) => {
  const message =
    ERROR_MESSAGES[errorCode] || "An error occurred. Please try again.";

  return (
    <div className="error-message">
      <span className="error-icon">⚠️</span>
      <span>{message}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Testing Error Handling

All error codes should be tested in the contract test suite to ensure proper error propagation. Run tests with:

```bash
cd contracts/raffle
cargo test
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always use Result types**: Never use `panic!()` or `expect()` in production code
2. **Provide meaningful error codes**: Use descriptive error codes that frontend can map to user messages
3. **Document all errors**: Keep this file updated with any new error codes
4. **Handle edge cases**: Test all error paths to ensure proper error propagation
5. **Use appropriate error granularity**: Different errors should have different codes for better UX
