# Raffle Contract Events

This document describes all events emitted by the Tikka raffle contract. The indexer uses these events to reconstruct complete raffle state without querying contract storage.

## Event Topic Scheme

All events use a consistent two-symbol topic structure:
```
("tikka", "event_name")
```

Where:
- First symbol: `"tikka"` (constant namespace identifier)
- Second symbol: Event name in snake_case matching the struct name

## Indexer Implementation Notes

1. **Event Ordering**: Events are emitted in chronological order within each transaction
2. **Multi-ticket Support**: `ticket_ids` in `ticket_purchased` is a vector to support future batch purchases
3. **Optional Fields**: Fields typed as `Option<T>` may be `None` - indexer must handle both cases
4. **Status Transitions**: `status_changed` events accompany most lifecycle events for redundancy
5. **Timestamps**: All timestamps are Unix seconds from ledger
6. **Fee Calculation**: Platform fees are calculated as `(amount * fee_bp) / 10000`
7. **Randomness Flow**: External randomness requires two events: `randomness_requested` → `randomness_received`

## Event Emission Guarantees

- Events are only emitted on successful state changes
- Failed transactions do not emit events
- Each state-changing function emits exactly one primary event
- Status changes emit both the primary event and `status_changed`
- No events are emitted for read-only operations
